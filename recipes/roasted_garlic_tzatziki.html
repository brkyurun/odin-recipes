    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I've made tzatziki loads of times, but this is my best recipe yet! The two
      keys are the roasted garlic, and straining the yogurt for 24 hours to make
      it like soft cheese. Tzatziki is great with crusty bread, french fries,
      pita bread, baked potatoes, or with any sort of wrap such as gyros,
      souvlaki, falafel or kebab. Also, I traditionally use fresh garlic, but
      this time I used ROASTED garlic. This made the tzatziki so much more
      flavorful, without that overpowering 'bite' that can come with lots of
      fresh garlic.

      <li>1 (16 ounce) container Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1/2 English cucumber</li>

      <li>
        Place yogurt in a paper coffee filter, paper towel or 4 layers of
        cheesecloth set in a strainer or colander, and then set over a bowl to
        catch the liquid. Allow yogurt to strain for 24 hours in the
        refrigerator.

        Peel and grate the cucumber, squeeze out excess water; place into a
